## Installation

**Requirements:**
- Node.js version **21.0.0** or higher.

```bash
npm install -g xcute-cli
```

or

```bash
pnpm add -g xcute-cli
```


## Quick Start

### 1. Add a simple action

An action is just **a name mapped to one or more commands**.

```bash
xcute add react "pnpm create vite . --action react"
```

### 2. Run it

```bash
xcute react
```

That’s it ^.^


## Using variables

Actions can contain variables using the `{{variable}}` syntax.

Example:

```bash
xcute add react \
  "pnpm create vite {{name}} --action react" \
  "cd {{name}}" \
  "pnpm install"
```

### Variables with description

You can provide a description for a variable to make the prompt more helpful using `{{variable::description}}` syntax:

```bash
xcute add my-action "echo {{name::Enter the project name}}"
```

If you use the same variable multiple times, you only need to add the description once:

```bash
xcute add my-action \
  "echo Creating {{name::Project Name}}" \
  "mkdir {{name}}" \
  "cd {{name}}"
```

### Variables with default values

You can provide a default value using `{{variable|default}}` syntax:

```bash
xcute add my-action "code {{path|.}}"
```

You can combine description and default value with `{{variable::description|default}}`:

```bash
xcute add my-action "echo {{name::Project Name|my-app}}"
```

Resolution order is:

1. Passed CLI value
2. Variable default value
3. Interactive prompt

Run it by passing values:

```bash
xcute react my-app
```

If a value is missing, `xcute` will **ask for it automatically**.

Variables are optional — if you don’t need them, don’t use them.

## Running actions (name or select)

### Run directly by name

```bash
xcute react my-app
```

This is the fastest way if you remember the name.

### Use interactive selection (recommended)

If you don’t remember the exact name:

```bash
xcute select # or xcute s
```

You’ll get a numbered list and can pick one.

#### Filtering actions

You can filter the list when you have many actions:

```bash
xcute select -f rea
```

Example:

* `react`
* `react-ts`
* `react-shadcn`

This makes `select` the **default workflow** for many users.

## Tip: shorten `xcute` to `x`

If you use `xcute` a lot, adding a shell alias can make common flows faster.

Example:

```bash
x add react "pnpm create vite . --action react"
x react
x select
```

### Linux / macOS

For `bash` or `zsh`, add this to your shell config:

```bash
alias x='xcute'
```

Common locations:

- `~/.bashrc`
- `~/.zshrc`

After saving, reload your shell:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
# or
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Windows

For PowerShell, add this function to your PowerShell profile:

```powershell
function x { xcute $args }
```

If your profile does not exist yet, create it first:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType File -Path $PROFILE -Force
```

Then open it:

```powershell
notepad $PROFILE
```

Save the function, then reload your profile:

```powershell
. $PROFILE
```

This gives you a short `x` command in every new PowerShell session.

For Command Prompt (`cmd.exe`), you can create a shortcut for the current session with:

```bat
doskey x=xcute $*
```


## Commands

### `xcute add <name> <commands...>`

Register a new action with one or more commands.

```bash
# Basic usage
xcute add <name> "command1" "command2" "command3"

# With description
xcute add <name> -d "My action description" "command1" "command2"

# Interactive mode
xcute add
```

Variables use `{{variable}}` syntax and are resolved at run time.

### `xcute run <name> [values...]`

Run a registered action.

On Unix-like systems, actions are executed through your current shell from `$SHELL` in interactive mode when available, so aliases and shell functions from your normal CLI are available there too.

```bash
# Pass variable values as arguments
xcute run react my-app

# Force interactive mode
xcute run react -i
```

### `xcute <name> [values...]`

Shortcut for `xcute run`.

```bash
xcute react my-app
```

### `xcute list`

List all registered actions.

```bash
# Table format (default)
xcute list
xcute list -c        # show commands
xcute list --no-table
```

### `xcute select`

Interactively select and run a action.

```bash
xcute select
xcute select -f react   # filter by name
```

### `xcute remove <name>`

Remove a action.

```bash
xcute remove react
xcute remove -s      # interactive selection
xcute remove -y      # skip confirmation
```

### `xcute export <path>`

Export your action registry to a JSON file (backup).

```bash
# Export to a file
xcute export backup.json

# Export to a directory (creates xcute.json)
xcute export ./backups/
```

### `xcute import <path>|<url>`

Import action from a JSON file or URL.

```bash
# Import from local file (merges with existing)
xcute import backup.json

# Import from URL
xcute import https://example.com/shared-actions.json

# Import from file and replace ALL existing actions
xcute import backup.json --replace
```

### Sync with a private Git repo

If you want the same registry on multiple machines, use a dedicated **private Git repository**.

`xcute` keeps a managed clone locally and syncs the exported registry file through Git.

This is safer and easier to reason about than using gists, especially when actions may contain private commands.

Avoid storing secrets directly in synced commands whenever possible.

### `xcute sync-init <repo-url>`

Initialize sync by cloning a Git repository used to store your registry snapshot.

```bash
# Use a private repository
xcute sync-init git@github.com:you/xcute-sync.git

# Store the registry in a custom path inside the repo
xcute sync-init git@github.com:you/xcute-sync.git --file data/xcute.json
```

### `xcute sync-pull`

Pull the remote registry snapshot and merge it into your local registry.

Conflicts are resolved per action name using one of these strategies:

- `prompt` asks you which version should win
- `local` keeps your local version
- `remote` uses the remote version

```bash
# Interactive conflict resolution (default)
xcute sync-pull

# Always prefer remote changes on conflicts
xcute sync-pull --strategy remote
```

### `xcute sync-push`

Merge local and remote changes, write the merged snapshot into the sync repo, then push it upstream.

```bash
# Interactive conflict resolution (default)
xcute sync-push

# Always prefer local changes on conflicts
xcute sync-push --strategy local
```

### `xcute sync-status`

Show the configured sync repo, tracked registry file, local drift since the last sync point, remote drift since the last sync point, and Git status for the managed clone.

```bash
xcute sync-status
```

### `xcute self-update [package-manager]`

Update the CLI to the latest version.

```bash
# Update using pnpm (default)
xcute self-update

# Update using npm
xcute self-update npm

# Update using yarn
xcute self-update yarn
```

## Examples

### Project templates

```bash
# React + Vite
xcute add react \
  "pnpm create vite {{name}} --action react-ts" \
  "cd {{name}}" \
  "pnpm install" \
  "code ."

# Next.js
xcute add next "pnpm create next-app {{name}}" "cd {{name}}" "code ."

# Express API
xcute add express "mkdir {{name}}" "cd {{name}}" "pnpm init -y" "pnpm add express" "code ."
```

### Dev shortcuts

```bash
# Git quick commit
xcute add gc "git add ." "git commit -m '{{message}}'" "git push"

# Docker compose
xcute add dcu "docker compose up -d"
xcute add dcd "docker compose down"

# SSH to server
xcute add ssh-prod "ssh {{user}}@production-server.com"
```

## Config location

Actions are stored at:

```
~/.xcute/config.json
```
